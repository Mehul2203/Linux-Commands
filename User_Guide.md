# User Guide
+ This is a repository I created to keep my notes for Linux commands. Go through the commands and try them in your Linux terminal for better understanding and to take a look at the outputs for each of the commands.     
+ There is some theoretical part before each of the topics along with some tips and shortcuts.    
+ Commands are given with their description of usage and how they work/outputs.     
+ If you have any concerns or suggestions, email me at [mehulbhargava22@gmail.com](mehulbhargava22@gmail.com).      
+ Thanks for visiting my repository, hope it helps you! ðŸŽ‡
