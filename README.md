 File system is similar to any other operating system.    
 + Folders are called as directories, sub-folders as sub-directories.         
 + "." represents current directory.    
 + ".." represents parent directory or parent.     
 + Absolute Path: starts from the root directory to the destination directory (complete/full path).      
 + Relative Path: Starts with the current working directory and gives a path for a location relative to the current working directory. Never starts with "/" (root) directory.        
 + "~" represents home directory.
 + When we open the terminal, by default we are in the home directory.
 + "*" means multiple files.
